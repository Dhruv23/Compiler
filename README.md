C Compiler Written in C++ (x86 / Linux) - March 2025
Developed a limited C compiler (simple types and syntax) in C++ with modular components: Flex-based lexer, recursive descent parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator using OOP design.
Built an abstract syntax tree with polymorphic codegen via virtual functions; implemented type inference, scoped symbol resolution, and a custom register allocator and label manager.
Debugged runtime issues using gdb on Linux, leveraging breakpoints, memory inspection, and stack tracing to validate AST traversal, register allocation, and code generation logic.
